# PHP_Minis
This repository contains mini, basic PHP projects that I did in my spare time.

In this repository you will find the following:
- Chess Board  (Front-End Only)
- Multidimensional Stock Table Array
- Conditionals Test
- Counting Table (Front-End Only)

These snippets were created by me during the first half of 2021 for practice purposes.
